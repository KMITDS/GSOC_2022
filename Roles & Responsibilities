Roles and Responsibilities:
There are always a lot of questions about what the expectations are for each role in the GSoC program. Organizations have developed their own, and this has resulted in wide variation. This documentation aims to standardize expectations across all participating organizations.

Individual organizations may have additional roles and responsibilities. Talk to your Organization Administrator for more information.
